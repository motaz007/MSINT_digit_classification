# Machine_learning

## Introduction
The reason for this project is to get familiar with machine learning and one of the elementary projects to start with is MNIST digit classification, which is fundemantally uses trains a model to be able to classify and identify MNIST handwritten digits.

I will implement this project at different stages, and with each stage trying to use less and less of off-the-shelf components. 

### Stage one
During stage one a VGG pre-trained model will be used, and the goal will be to develop the pipline from loading the data into the model and track the accuracy of the predictions.
